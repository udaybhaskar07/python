Data Modelling

PQE & 	Power Pivot

PQE --> Transformations --> M (Mashup) language --> ETL of Power BI (Extract, Tranform, Load)
Power Pivot --> Transfromations, Calculations --> DAX (Data ANALYTICAL/ANALYSIS expressions) -- InMemory Columnar Database. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between Traditional databases and InMemory Databases.

Tranditional Databases: (RDBMS)
Ex: MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle Etc
--> Data is stored in Row Format.
--> Data will be stored in disk and accessed from Disk.
--> Size is Huge

InMerory Database:
--> data is stored in Column level when ever we start to store the data.
--> Data is stored in RAM and accesssed from RAM.
--> Data is highly compressed.
--> Faster in Working

PQE (10GB) --> Premium
PQE (100GB) --> Power Pivot (10GB) --> X-Velocity Engine( Vertipaq Engine)
PQE(1000GB) -- ?

PQE --> SSIS,Azure Data Bricks
Power Pivot (DAX) , Data Modelling (Schemas/Models) --> SSAS
Store this Models created in SSAS --> SSMS or Azure Analytical Service
Pipeline Tool --> AZure Data Factory

Power BI -- Power View

Vertipaq Engine (X-Velocity Engine):
--> When ever we are sending data from PQE to Power Pivot this comes into Picture.
--> InMemory database properties (Columnar Storage).
--> This will reduce the size of data to 1/10th of original Size.
--> Aggregate functions works faster.
--> Tiem consuming.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Licences in Power BI

Pro - 1GB
Premium - 10GB
PPU

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Connectivity Modes

Import - Data in presentr ion Power BI.
Direct Query - Data is not present but columns/measures created can be accessed from database/Cloud.
Live - Data is not present but columns/measures created can be accessed from Cloud.

Data Modelling? Establishing a relationship between two tables.
Types of Relationships

-- One to one
-- One to Many
-- Many to one
-- Many to many

How to establish a new relationship?
Home tab --> Manage relationships --> New relationship --> select first table --> select column -> select secodn table --> select column --> select the type of relationship --> select crossfilter direction --> Active/inactive --> Okay.

Edit relarionship
Home tab --> Manage relationships --> Edit relationship --> select first table --> select column -> select secodn table --> select column --> select the type of relationship --> select crossfilter direction --> Active/inactive --> Okay.

Delete relationship --> This will delete the relationship
Auto detect relationship
	- This will automatically detect the relationship when data is loaded for the first time.
	- File --> Option & setting --> options --> data load --> relationships --> checkbox auto detect relationships when 	data is loaded.

cross filter directions
	-- Single (One way (table1 - table2 ) or (table2 - table1)
	-- Both

Active relationships
Assume referential Integrity

Models/Schemas in Power BI

https://www.powerbitraining.com.au/schemas-in-a-data-model/

https://www.simplilearn.com/fact-table-vs-dimension-table-article#:~:text=Fact%20tables%20have%20more%20records,table%20has%20a%20concatenated%20key.
https://www.guru99.com/fact-table-vs-dimension-table.html

Fact Column - Measures (Sales, Profit, Quantity) Etc
Dimension Column - Market,segemnt,country ID's Etc
Fact Table - Foreign Key + Fact columns
Dimension Table - Primary Key + Dimension columns (Categorical)

1. Star Schema - When all the Dimension tables are directly linked with Fact table.
-- Faster
-- Less Tables
-- Large data 

2. Snowflake Schema - Dimension tables are interlinked with other dimension tables and fact table
-- More tables
-- Slower

3. Galaxy Schema - Multiple Star Schemas together. Dimension tables are connected with multiple Fact tables.

--------------------------------------------------------
How many relationships can be established between two tables? More than 1
How many active relationships can be established between two tables? Only 1
Which Schema is better at performance? -- Star Schema
