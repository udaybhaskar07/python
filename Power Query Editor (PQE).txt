Why is it called PQE?
As the imported data is called Query, We Edit (Transformations) on Query hence know as PQE.

What is Query?

	Tabs --> Groups --> Options
2. Query Pane --> Query is the data table.
	Table --> Database we call table
	Query --> Same tables in database is known as Query in PQE.
3. Formula Bar - Display the M-language for all the steps applied.
4. Data View/Result View - Display the data and also diplays the result of transformed data.
5. Query Settings Pane

Transfrom and Add column

Transfrom - Will perform changes on the same column selected
Add column - Will perform changes by adding a new column at the end of data.

Transpose - Shift the data from row to columns and vireversa.
Reverse rows - This is shifting the data up side down.
Count Rows - Thsi gives the count of all the rows in the data.
Detect datatype - this helps you to detect the datatype of a column.
Fill
	Fill up - this will fill the before empty/null cell with the next value.
	Fill Down - this will fill the succeding empty/null cell with the before value.
Pivot - Separate the distinct value in a selected column to individual Columns.
	 - This gives the summary of the column selected by gioving the summation of value column.
Uppivot - Reverting the pivot applied.
Move -
	Right - shift the column to one step right.
	Left - shift the column to one step left.
